## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project I learned how to create a basic accordion without using JavaScript. I also learned how to use the `:checked` pseudo-class to style the accordion, along with `::before` and `::after` pseudoelements to add a pointing up/down arrow according to the accordion menu state (open/closed).
I learned that sometimes it's better to not use javascript, and that it's possible to create a functional accordion without it, this results in a better performance page.


### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about CSS and how to use it to create more complex layouts and animations. I also want to learn more about when to use JavaScript and when not to use it.

### Useful resources

- [Make a pure CSS accordion withour javascript](https://supfort.com/pure-css-accordion-without-javascript) - This helped me to create an easy to use accordion without using JavaScript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward for maximizing page performance.
- [Adding toggle plus and minus signs to a pure CSS accordion](https://supfort.com/add-toggle-plus-minus-css-accordion) - This is little article that helped me to add the down and up arrow to the accordion. Instead of using the example minus and plus signs, I used the down arrow asset and with css I rotate it when the accordion content is open.
